Displaying Regular Polygons

Problem description: Create a subclass of JPane, named RegularPolygonPane, to paint an n-sided regular polygon. The class contains a property named numberOfSides, which specifies the number of sides in the polygon. The polygon is centered at the center of the Pane. The size of the polygon is proportional to the size of the Pane. Create a pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, and octagon, nonagon, and decagon from RegularPolygonPane and display them in a frame.
An example output is in the directory.

1. Define a class named RegularPolygonPane to paint an n-sided regular polygon. (So, if n is 3, it paints a triangle, if n is 4, it paints a square, etc.)
2. Create a frame classes that contains pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, and octagon, nonagon, and decagon. These objects are created from RegularPolygonPane.
3. Draw a UML class diagram for the RegularPolygonPane class and the frame class.
		
##Tasks
